# 🎬 Netflix Content Strategy & Global Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's library, including Movies and TV Shows. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand content distribution, audience reception (ratings), and geographic trends to drive data-informed decisions for content acquisition and production.

## 🚀 Business Use Case (The "Why")
This dashboard answers critical business questions such as:
- **Content Performance:** Which genres are achieving the highest average ratings versus their volume of production?
- **Market Penetration:** Where is the content being produced geographically and how does the rating vary by country?
- **Library Balance:** What is the ratio between Movies and TV Shows, and how does the rating distribution look (Bell curve analysis)?
- **Audience Engagement:** Correlation between the number of votes and the average rating per title.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Global Map Visualization:** Interactive map showing production hubs and performance metrics by region.
- **Genre Deep-Dive:** A dual-axis chart comparing the number of titles vs. average ratings across genres like War, Music, Drama, and Sci-Fi.
- **Rating Distribution:** A pyramid chart showing the concentration of titles by rating group (mostly centered around 6-8).
- **Dynamic KPIs:** Real-time summary of total titles, average ratings, and total votes for both Movies and TV Shows.
- **Top Content List:** A detailed view of high-performing titles like *The Queen's Gambit* and *The Umbrella Academy*.
